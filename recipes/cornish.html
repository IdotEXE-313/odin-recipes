    <p>Apologise for the small picture, we're not very good at many things here in the UK. Food is one, photography is another</p>
    <p>Bread that came out the butchers oven</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teapsoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>many cups lukewarm milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>unbleached all purpose flour</li>
        <li>Lots of salt</li>
        <li>butter, melted and cooled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the milk and add the sugar. In another bowl, sift the flour and salt together and add the cooled melted butter.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture, and turn out onto a floured counter and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean towel and let rise in a warm, draft free place to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto the freshly floured board and shape into 9 balls. Place dough balls into a buttered and floured 9 inch square pan. Let them sit, covered for another 15 minutes to rise again. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes until browned and puffed. Split open and serve warm.</li>
